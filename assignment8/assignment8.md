## Problem 1
Factor the polynomial \(1+x+x^2+2x^3+x4∈ℤ_3[x].\)

## Problem 2
Square-and-multiply modular exponentiation. Let \(q\) be a prime power. Present an algorithm that, given \(m∈ℤ_{≥1}, f∈𝔽_q[x],\) and \(g∈𝔽_q[x]∖\{0\}\) with \(\deg f, \deg g≤d∈ℤ_{≥1}\) as input, computes \(f^m \operatorname{rem} g\) in \(O(M(d) \log m)\) operations in \(𝔽_q.\) Carefully justify the number of operations used by your algorithm.
